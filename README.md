git clone git@github.com:mesnilgr/iclr15.git
cd iclr15; chmod +x oh_my_go.sh
./oh_my_go.sh
```

#In terms of timing:

#downloading the data, tokenizing this will take 68 mins. Note that most of the time is spent dowloading and tokenizing. Once the data has been downloaded and tokenized, training an NB-SVM only takes ~2 mins for uni+bigrams and <5 mins for uni+bi+trigrams.
